I have just met Sirs Marie, Maurice and April. 
Sir April said: "exactly one of Sir Marie, Sir Maurice and Sir April is a Knave." 
I asked Sir Patricia who he was,
and he answered impatiently: "Sir Marie, Sir Maurice, Sir April, Sir Brown, Sir Patricia or Sir Manuel is a Knight." 

# I have just met Sirs Frank, Paul and Nina.
# Sir Nina said: "I am a Knight," but I am not sure
# if that is true. What do you think?

# Yesterday, I visited Sirs Andrew and Nancy.
# I asked Sir Andrew who he was, and he answered impatiently: "Sir Nancy and I are Knaves!"
# Then I met Sir Bill who introduced me to his wife and told me: "at least one of Sir Hilary and I is a Knave."
# Should I trust them?

# I have just seen Sirs Sanjay and Eleonore!
# "I am a Knave," whispered Sir Eleonore.
# Who is a Knight and who is a Knave?
